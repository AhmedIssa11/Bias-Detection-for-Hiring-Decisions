# Bias-Detection-for-Hiring-Decisions

Here’s a comprehensive breakdown of the technical steps needed to build a **Real-Time Bias Detection** application for hiring decisions using the Google Gemini API and either Google AI Studio or Vertex AI:

### 1. **Project Setup**

#### a. **Environment Setup**
   - **Google Cloud Account:** Create or use an existing Google Cloud account.
   - **Enable APIs:** Enable the necessary APIs, including the **Gemini API**, **Vertex AI**, and any other relevant services.
   - **Google AI Studio or Vertex AI:** Set up a project in either Google AI Studio or Vertex AI for developing your application.

#### b. **Data Preparation**
   - **Choose Dataset:** Select the dataset you want to use.
   - **Data Cleaning:** Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies.
   - **Feature Selection:** Identify relevant features for bias analysis, such as:
     - **Applicant demographics:** Gender, age, education, etc.
     - **Employment outcomes:** Whether the applicant was hired or not (the target variable).

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

#### a. **Analyze Data Distribution**
   - Visualize the distribution of key features (e.g., demographics) to identify any apparent biases.
   - Use tools like **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, or **Seaborn** for visualization.

#### b. **Bias Detection Metrics**
   - Define metrics to quantify bias, such as:
     - **Disparate Impact Ratio:** Compare hiring rates among different demographic groups.
     - **Equal Opportunity:** Assess true positive rates across groups.
     - **Predictive Parity:** Check if the model's predictive performance is consistent across groups.

### 3. **Model Development**

#### a. **Data Splitting**
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets (e.g., 70% training, 15% validation, 15% test).

#### b. **Model Selection**
   - Choose machine learning models to predict hiring outcomes (e.g., **Logistic Regression**, **Random Forest**, or **Gradient Boosting**).

#### c. **Training the Model**
   - Train the selected model using the training dataset.
   - Use Google AI Studio or Vertex AI to leverage GPU/TPU for faster training.

#### d. **Bias Detection in Model**
   - After training, assess bias in the model's predictions using the metrics defined earlier.
   - Use Google’s **Explainable AI** tools to gain insights into model predictions and detect biases.

### 4. **Real-Time Bias Detection Feature**

#### a. **Develop a Bias Detection API**
   - Create an API endpoint that allows users to submit applicant data and receive bias analysis.
   - Use the Gemini API to facilitate this.

#### b. **Real-Time Analysis**
   - Implement real-time analysis to check the submitted applicant data against the trained model.
   - Use bias metrics to provide feedback on potential biases in hiring practices based on the incoming data.

### 5. **User Interface Development**

#### a. **Build User Interface**
   - Create a simple front-end application (web or mobile) where users can:
     - Input applicant data.
     - View bias detection results and recommendations.

#### b. **Integration**
   - Integrate the front-end with the bias detection API to facilitate user interactions.

### 6. **Testing and Validation**

#### a. **Model Validation**
   - Validate the model’s performance on the test dataset to ensure it generalizes well.
   - Assess the model for fairness using the bias metrics defined earlier.

#### b. **User Testing**
   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the interface and bias detection features.

### 7. **Deployment**

#### a. **Deploy the Application**
   - Deploy the application on Google Cloud, using services like **App Engine** or **Cloud Run**.
   - Ensure that the application is accessible to users.

#### b. **Monitoring and Maintenance**
   - Set up monitoring tools to track model performance and user interactions.
   - Continuously improve the model and bias detection mechanisms based on user feedback and new data.

### 8. **Documentation and Submission**

#### a. **Create Documentation**
   - Document the entire project, including:
     - Data sources.
     - Model development process.
     - Bias detection methods.
     - User instructions.

#### b. **Prepare Submission Materials**
   - Create a public link to your project, a Google Project ID, and a public code repository (e.g., GitHub).
   - Prepare a summary description and a demonstration video showcasing the application.
